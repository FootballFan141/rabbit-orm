The Elegant ORM brings the beauty and simplicity of working with Eloquent ORM in Laravel to CodeIgniter framework.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n- Download the zipball\r\n- Extract to your `application/libraries` directory\r\n- In your `config/autoload.php` file, add `elegant-orm/elegant` to `$autoload['libraries']`. So it will look like this:\r\n\r\n  ```php\r\n  $autoload['libraries'] = array('elegant-orm/elegant');\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n### Defining Models\r\nModels in Elegant ORM (as in other ORMs) represent a single table to work with. To define a model, it's about the same with non-ORM CodeIgniter, but instead of extending `CI_Model`, the ORM model should extends `Elegant\\Model` class.\r\n\r\n*Example:* Model for table user, located in `models/user.php`\r\n\r\n```php\r\nclass User extends Elegant\\Model {\r\n  protected $table = \"user\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `$table` property is used to tell which table the model will work with. There are also several properties to customize the model configuration.\r\n\r\n### Model properties\r\nHere are some properties you can use to customize the model\r\n\r\n- `$table` : to define the table name. This property is mandatory to set\r\n- `$db_group` : to define which database group the model will connect. The groups can be found in `config/database.php`. By default it uses \"default\" group\r\n- `$primary` : to define the column name of the table's primary key. Default is \"id\". If your PK has other name than \"id\" you should change this\r\n- `$incrementing` : to define whether your PK is auto-increment. Default value is `true`. If you'd like to generate your Primary Key value by custom function, set this to `false`\r\n\r\n## Querying\r\n### Retrieve all models\r\n```php\r\n$users = User::all();\r\nforeach($users as $user)\r\n{\r\n  echo $user->name;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Find a model by primary key\r\n```php\r\n$user = User::find(1);\r\necho $user->name;\r\n```\r\nYou can also pass multiple IDs or an array to get multiple records.\r\n```php\r\n$users = User::find(1, 2, 3);\r\n// or\r\n$users = User::find( array(1, 2, 3) );\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Custom Query\r\nYou can still use Code Igniter Active Record to generate a custom query.\r\n```php\r\n$users = User::where('status', 1)->get();\r\n\r\nforeach($users as $user) echo $user->name;\r\n```\r\nOr if you only want to retrieve the first record, you can use `first()` method\r\n```php\r\n$user = User::where('status', 1)->first();\r\necho $user->name;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Create, Update & Delete\r\n### Creating A New Model\r\n```php\r\n$user =  new User;\r\n\r\n$user->name = 'John Doe';\r\n$user->email = 'dummy@example.com';\r\n\r\n$user->save();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter saving the record, if your model uses auto increment primary key, the generated insert id will be set to the object. So if you use example above, you can show the new user's ID right away\r\n```php\r\necho \"New User ID: \" . $user->id;\r\n```\r\nNote that the property isn't always `id`. It depends on the `primary` property you've set before.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can use `create` method to create new models.\r\n```php\r\n$user = User::create( array('name' => 'John Doe', 'email' => 'dummy@example.com') );\r\n\r\n// create() method will return a newly created model or false if inserting fails\r\necho $user->id;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Updating Models\r\n#### Updating Retrieved Model\r\n```php\r\n$user = User::find(1);\r\n\r\n$user->name = 'Jack Doe';\r\n$user->save();\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Mass Updating\r\nYou still can use CodeIgniter Active Record to generate a custom query before updating.\r\n```php\r\nUser::where('status', 1)->update( array('name' => 'Jane Doe') );\r\n```\r\nOr alternatively you can call `update` method right away.\r\n```php\r\nUser::update( array('name' => 'Jane Doe'), array('id' => 1) );\r\n// The first parameter is the new data, and the second is the \"where\" condition\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Deleting Models\r\nThere are several ways to delete model\r\n```php\r\n// Delete retrieved model\r\n$user = User::find(1);\r\n$user->delete();\r\n\r\n// Delete a single model by its primary key\r\nUser::delete(1);\r\n\r\n// Delete multiple models by their primary keys\r\nUser::delete(1, 2, 3);\r\n//or\r\nUser::delete( array(1, 2, 3) );\r\n\r\n// Use Active Record\r\nUser::where('status', 1)->delete();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Query Scopes\r\nScopes is a custom function you can create in your models to generate custom queries\r\n\r\n### Defining A Scope\r\nSome conventions:\r\n- Scope method name must be in camel case\r\n- Scope method name must be start with `scope`\r\n- At least one parameter is required. This first parameter is a `QueryBuilder` which you can use to call Active Record methods\r\n\r\n```php\r\nclass User extends Elegant\\Model {\r\n  protected $table = \"user\";\r\n  \r\n  function scopeActive($query)\r\n  {\r\n    return $query->where('status', 1)->order_by('name');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Utilizing Scopes\r\nUsing example above, you can do this in your controller\r\n```php\r\n$active_users = User::active()->get();\r\n```\r\nNote that the method name isn't using `scope` prefix.\r\n\r\n### Dynamic Scopes\r\nScopes can also accept parameters to be used in generating queries.\r\n```php\r\nclass User extends Elegant\\Model {\r\n  protected $table = \"user\";\r\n  \r\n  // Search an active user by name\r\n  function scopeSearch($query, $keyword)\r\n  {\r\n    return $query->like('name', $keyword)->where('status', 1);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// In your controller\r\n$search_results = User::search('John')->get();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Relationship\r\n### One to One\r\n#### Defining One to One Relationship\r\nThis the example how to define a one-to-one relationship between a `User` model with `Phone`. In this case, a `User` might have one `Phone`\r\n```php\r\nclass User extends Elegant\\Model {\r\n  protected $table = \"user\";\r\n  \r\n  function phone()\r\n  {\r\n    return $this->hasOne('Phone');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe parameter to `hasOne` method is the name of the related model. Once the relationship set you can retrieve it in you controller this way:\r\n```php\r\n$user = User::find(1);\r\n$phone = $user->phone;\r\n// You can work with $phone object like the usual way\r\n\r\n// Returns its property\r\necho $phone->brand;\r\n\r\n// Or updates it\r\n$phone->brand = \"Samsung\";\r\n$phone->save();\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: the name of the method where you call the `hasOne` isn't have to be the same with the related model name. You can name it anything you want, just make sure it doesn't conflict with exisiting table field name.\r\n\r\nIn the example above the foreign key in `phone` table is assumed to be `user_id` (lowercased related model's name with `_id` suffix). You can define custom key name as second parameter if your foreign key doesn't match this convention.\r\n```php\r\n$this->hasOne('Phone', 'custom field name');\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Defining the Inverse Relationship\r\nYou can also define the inverse of the relationship. For the example after you get a Phone object, you want to know who is the name owner. In the `Phone` model you have to call the `belongsTo` method.\r\n```php\r\nclass Phone extends Elegant\\Model {\r\n  protected $table = \"phone\";\r\n  \r\n  function owner()\r\n  {\r\n    return $this->belongsTo('User');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// In your controller:\r\n$phone = Phone::find(1);\r\n\r\necho $phone->owner->name;\r\n```\r\nYou can also define a custom foreign key as second parameter to `belongsTo` method.\r\n\r\n### One to Many\r\n#### Defining One to Many Relationship\r\nAn example of one to many relationship is an article can has one or many comments. To define such relationship, you can do this:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nclass Article extends Elegant\\Model {\r\n  protected $table = \"article\";\r\n  \r\n  function comments()\r\n  {\r\n    return $this->hasMany('Comment');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe difference between `hasOne` and `hasMany` is the `hasMany` will return an array of matched models, while `hasOne` will return only one model. So in your controller, you should use like this:\r\n```php\r\n$article = Article::find(1);\r\n\r\nforeach($article->comments() as $comment)\r\n{\r\n  echo $comment->text;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Defining the Inverse Relationship\r\nAs in one to one relationship you can define the inverse relationship between `Comment` and `Article` model.\r\n```php\r\nclass Comment extends Elegant\\Model {\r\n  protected $table = \"comment\";\r\n  \r\n  function article()\r\n  {\r\n    return $this->belongsTo('Article');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// In controllers\r\n$comment = Comment::find(1);\r\n\r\nreturn $comment->article->title;\r\n```\r\nAgain, you can set a custom foreign key to `belongsTo` method as stated in the One to One section.\r\n\r\n### Many to Many\r\n#### Defining Many to Many Relationship\r\nMany to many relationship is the most complex relationship. It requires a pivot table to bridge the relation between two models.\r\n\r\nAn example of this relationship is between an `Article` model with a `Tag` model. An article might has one or more tag while a tag can also be in one on more article.\r\n\r\nTo define the relationship, you should do this:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nclass Article extends Elegant\\Model {\r\n  protected $table = \"article\";\r\n  \r\n  function tags()\r\n  {\r\n    return $this->belongsToMany('Tag');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo retrieve the tags:\r\n```php\r\n$article = Article::find(1);\r\n\r\nforeach($article->tags as $tag)\r\n{\r\n  echo $tag->name;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you can do vice-versa in `Tag` model:\r\n```php\r\nclass Tag extends Elegant\\Model {\r\n  protected $table = \"tag\";\r\n  \r\n  function articles()\r\n  {\r\n    return $this->belongsToMany('Article');\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// In controllers\r\n$tag = Tag::find(1);\r\nforeach($tag->articles as $article)\r\n{\r\n  echo $article->title;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Customizing Pivot Table\r\nBy default Elegant will assume that the name of pivot table is the concatenated name of two models using underscore in alphabetical order. So if the models are `Article` and `Tag`, the default pivot table name is `article_tag`.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use another name for the pivot table you can specify in second parameter of the `belongsToMany` method.\r\n```php\r\n// Use a custom pivot table name\r\n$this->belongsToMany('Tag', 'custom pivot name');\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also customize the name of associated keys in the pivot. By default it uses the same convention as in One to One or One to Many. So for the example, in `article_tag` table, the fields will be `article_id` and `tag_id`.\r\n\r\nTo customize the key name, you can pass third and/or fourth parameter. The third parameter is the associated key of current model, while the fourth is for the related model.\r\n\r\nBasicly, this is a `belongsToMany` will look like:\r\n```php\r\n$this->belongsToMany('Tag', 'article_tag', 'article_id', 'tag_id');\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
